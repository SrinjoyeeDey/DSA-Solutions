# Knight Problem (Backtracking)

## 📖 Problem Statement
Find all possible paths a knight can take to reach from (0,0) to (N-1,N-1) on an N×N chessboard.

## 🧩 Example Input / Output
Input: N = 4  
Output: List of all valid paths

## 🚀 Approach
- Used backtracking to explore moves
- Pruned invalid moves (out of board or already visited)
- Recorded paths when destination was reached

## ⏱ Time Complexity
- O(8^(N^2)) worst case
- Optimized by backtracking
