# 🚀 My DSA & Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and Problem-Solving repository!
This repo is more than just solutions — it’s my personal growth tracker, learning log, and initiative to maintain discipline while building problem-solving excellence.

## 📌 Why I Started This Repository

To track my progress across different coding challenges.

To create a personal knowledge base that I can revisit anytime.

To showcase my initiative, consistency, and coding discipline to recruiters and peers.

To stand out from the crowd by not just solving problems but also documenting my journey.


## ✨ What Makes This Repository Different?

🔥 Well-Structured Solutions – categorized by topic (Recursion, DP, Graphs, etc.).

📖 Clear Explanations – every solution has comments & approaches, not just code dumps.

✅ Multiple Approaches – where possible, I’ve included both brute-force and optimized versions.

🏷 Tagging by Difficulty – problems are labeled as Easy, Medium, Hard for better navigation.

🔄 Consistent Updates – I treat this repo like a daily learning diary.

🌟 Recruiter-Friendly – designed to reflect initiative, consistency, and problem-solving mindset.

# 🧠 My Philosophy

> “Don’t just solve problems. Build habits. Learn patterns. Stand out.”



This repo reflects my mindset of growth, not just coding. Anyone can write code — but writing, tracking, and explaining consistently is what makes a true engineer stand out.

# 💡 Future Standout Features I Plan to Add

🔍 Searchable Index of Problems (so anyone can find by tag/topic easily)

📊 Graphs of My Progress (automated via GitHub Actions)

🌍 Open for Collaboration – others can contribute their approaches too
